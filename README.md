# excelbootcamps
I would like to thank the team at Ryerson Bootcamps for giving me the opportunity to achieve the Power of Excel certfication by completing three levels in the Excel bootcamps. Participating in the three bootcamps allowed for me to enhance my skills using Microsoft Excel by learning new approaches to use Excel to collect information needed to solve different business problems.
